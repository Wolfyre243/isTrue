# Introduction
`isTrue` is an incredibly useful tool to help you check if your value is ... well, true.
And if it isn't ‚ùå, then it returns false! How efficient!

Plus, this tool is extremely strict too, so you can't pass a string, or an array.
This makes your code 100 times more secure and easy to read!

Say goodbye to confusing code, and hello to the revolutionary `isTrue`!

If you liked this tool, then don't forget to look for its sister, `isFalse`!

# Usage
```js
const isTrue = require('@useless-thingys/isTrue');

const bool = false;
isTrue(true); // true
isTrue(bool); //false
```
